# WDI30 Project 2: GamesPost

## Introduction

GamesPost was the app I created for project 2 during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly London, to create this app I used Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, EJS, SCSS and Bootstrap. This app will connect the competitive gaming community as there are a lot of players out there looking for people to play tournaments with and I know this as I use to be one of those players.

## The Idea

The idea with this app was to create something that would connect competitive gamers together as there are a lot of players out there that don't have a team and there are a lot of teams out there that are looking for one or two players to join them in online tournaments etc. This app allows solo players or teams to post a game or tournament onto the app which other players or teams can comment on and say whether they would like to play or not.

## What was a success?

My greatest achievement during this project was getting the basic functionality working aka getting the character to move side to side and getting the items to fall, This went very well for me and I enjoyed it alot as I could explore the interenet and the world of JavaScript for solutions and tips to get this functionality working.

Example code:



## Challenges

During this project a big challenge for me was getting collision to work on my game as I needed it so that the unicorn could collect the falling coins, this was a long and complicated task and it consumed most of my time during this project but after reading endless StackOverflow posts and getting help off my colleagues I finally got it working. This was a huge lesson for me as I realised that some parts of code are like mini projects and take alot of time and studying to get working.

## Conclusion 

Overall this project was great as it was good to get to study and learn Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 as individuals making a cool game.
